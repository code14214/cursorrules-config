# Cursor AI Rules for Reduced Autonomy

The `.cursorrules` file defines behavior rules for the Cursor AI assistant. These rules enable the full intelligence of "Agent Mode" to be used while simultaneously restricting autonomy - the AI assistant shows plans, waits for confirmations and does not perform automatic changes.

## Usage

1. **Local usage**: Copy the `.cursorrules` file to your project directory
2. **Global usage**: Place the file in your home directory for global settings
